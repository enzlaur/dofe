Mr. Tolibas,
 
Good day.
 
The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award (https://www.dofe.org/) inspires young people to develop the skills they need to succeed in work and life. The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award help young people unlock their potential and build a brighter future. South Hill School Inc. is an independent award giver in Los Baños, Laguna for the Duke of Edinburgh Awards.
 
The Award allows young people to develop a skill, engage in physical recreation, provide service, and go on an adventurous Journey. We would like to ask for your assistance twofold.
 
1.       The Adventurous Journey, which may be held as a cultural exchange with another country, or an eco-exploration within the Philippines require money that may not be available to all that deserve to be awarded. Continued financial support over the next few year will ensure that the underprivileged youth can be awarded for his efforts even if he wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford it.
 
2.       The Service portion of the program require that participants to give one hour of unpaid service to the community. If you have any programs that require volunteers, we would be very enthusiastic to have our participants help out.
 
If you can spare us some time, we would like to set a meeting with you to explore the possibility of working together where we can give you media mileage in our events and activities.
 
We look forward to hearing a positive response from you.
 
Warm regards,
 
Joel Donato Jacob
